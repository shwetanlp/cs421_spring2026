## Gradescope Assignments  
There are **4 Gradescope assignments** with a mix of theoretical and coding questions (Python).  
- The coding component focuses on implementing and evaluating NLP algorithms discussed in class.  
- The written component focuses on analysis of the implemented methods.  
- **Note:** The first Python assignment is **optional for graduate students**.

**Grading:**  
- **Coding Questions:**  
  - **80%** — Program functionality (implementation, models, evaluation metrics)  
  - **20%** — Code quality (clean, readable, well-designed code)  
- **Written Questions:**  
  - **70%** — Accuracy  
  - **30%** — Clarity

## Regrading Policy  
- Requests must be made **within one week** of the assignment being returned.  
- **Arithmetic errors:** Attach a note explaining the mistake → points corrected before semester ends.  
- **Other grading concerns:**  
  - Write a short note explaining why you believe more points should be awarded.  
  - Attach it to the front of your assignment and give it to your TA.  
  - Keep a photocopy for your records.  
  - These requests will be reviewed **at the end of the semester** after final grades are calculated.
