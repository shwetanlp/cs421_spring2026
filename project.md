# Graduate Research Project (CS-421)

## Guidelines

The goal of this project is to explore different directions in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and identify a focused research topic for your graduate project.

You should:

- Explore different directions in NLP  
- Look at existing datasets and shared tasks in those areas  
- Get a sense of:
  - What the task is
  - What kind of input/output is being used
  - How systems are evaluated
  - What baseline models already exist  

After reviewing a few directions and datasets, you will meet with an instructor to:

- Narrow down your topic  
- Decide on a concrete problem statement  
- Define the focus of your final project (e.g., modeling, analysis, comparison)

> **Note:**  
> For your graduate project, you do **not** need to choose a problem from the shared tasks listed below or define a full research problem right away.  
>  
> These topics are meant to help you explore areas of interest, not to lock you into a specific idea.

## Research Topics

### 1. Emotion, Sentiment, and Stance

Tasks in this area examine how people express feelings, opinions, or positions in text and beyond.

**You might explore:**
- Emotion recognition  
- Stance detection (support, oppose, neutral)  
- Multimodal emotion or stance detection (text + images, audio, or video)

**Shared Tasks:**
- https://github.com/emotion-analysis-project/SemEval2025-task11  
- https://zeroqiaoba.github.io/MER2025-website/#introduction  

### 2. Question Answering (Q&A)

These tasks focus on systems that answer questions based on internal or external knowledge.

**You might explore:**
- Answering questions from documents  
- Open-domain question answering  
- Multi-step reasoning questions  

**Shared Tasks:**
- https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2024  
- https://www.codabench.org/competitions/3360/

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG systems combine search/retrieval with text generation.

**You might explore:**
- Comparing retrieval methods  
- Multi-document RAG  
- Evaluating faithfulness and correctness of RAG systems  
- Domain-specific RAG (e.g., finance, medicine)

**Shared Tasks:**
- https://ibm.github.io/mt-rag-benchmark/MTRAGEval/  
- https://sites.google.com/view/semeval2026-task12/introduction  

### 4. Text Generation, Reasoning, and Reliability

This area looks at how and why models generate text—and when they make mistakes.

**You might explore:**
- Interpreting model outputs  
- Causal, logical, or mathematical reasoning  
- Controlled text generation  
- Hallucinations in generated text  

**Shared Tasks:**
- https://sites.google.com/view/semeval2026-task12/  
- https://helsinki-nlp.github.io/shroom/  
- https://llmunlearningsemeval2025.github.io/  


### 5. Summarization

Summarization tasks require models to shorten text while preserving key information.

**You might explore:**
- Long-document summarization  
- Factual consistency in summaries  
- Simplified or lay summaries  
- Domain-specific summarization (news, scientific, medical)  
- Evaluation metrics for summarization  

**Shared Tasks:**
- https://peranssumm.github.io/docs/  
- https://biolaysumm.org/  


### 6. Multimodal NLP

Multimodal tasks combine language with other modalities.

**You might explore:**
- Vision–language tasks such as image captioning  
- Image-based question answering  
- Multimodal emotion recognition  
- Cross-modal reasoning  

**Shared Tasks:**
- https://fever.ai/task.html  
- https://visualqa.org/  
- https://nocaps.org/  


### 7. Fact Checking and Misinformation

These tasks focus on verifying claims and detecting false or misleading information.

**You might explore:**
- Automated fact checking  
- Evidence retrieval for claims  
- Explainable verification  
- Misinformation in social media  
- Multimodal misinformation (text + images)

**Shared Tasks:**
- https://checkthat.gitlab.io/clef2026/  


### 8. Social Media and Mental Health

These tasks use text from social platforms to study behavior, opinions, and well-being.

**You might explore:**
- Mental health states and symptoms in text or images (e.g., memes)  
- Hate speech or harmful content detection  
- Bias and fairness issues  

**Shared Tasks:**
- https://sites.google.com/site/offensevalsharedtask/  
- https://clpsych.org/shared-task/  


### 9. Conversational Systems and Dialogue

These tasks focus on building and analyzing systems that interact with users via conversation.

**You might explore:**
- Task-oriented dialogue systems (e.g., recommendation systems)  
- Open-domain conversational agents  
- Response generation and ranking  
- Consistency and coherence in dialogue  
- Hallucinations and factuality in responses  
- Safety and harmful behavior in conversational systems  

**Shared Tasks:**

- https://sites.google.com/view/persona-knowledge-workshop/shared-task  
- https://dstc12.dstc.community/  


## Why Shared Tasks?

Shared tasks and benchmarks are an excellent starting point because they:

- Provide ready-to-use datasets  
- Clearly define tasks  
- Explain evaluation metrics  
- Often include starter code  

You are encouraged to explore shared task websites to review datasets and task formulations before finalizing your research project topic.
